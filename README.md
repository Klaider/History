# Klaider Animekist History

My profile is split and sparse to find on the internet, so I decided to create a note to comprove what I did.

## Nicknames

- 1. Caiolopelopes
  - When I requested my brother to create me an Orkut account, he gave me that name, although in reality I am Matheus.
  - My first Transformice account used that name: [Caiolopelope](https://atelier801.com/profile?pr=Caiolopelope) ([thread example](https://atelier801.com/topic?f=6&t=690610&p=1#m6;)), registered in 2011. Note that most of my art galleries in Atelier 801 have been deleted.
- 2. Klaider
- 3. Recoyx
- 4. Animex Kai
- 5. Hydroper
- 6. HandOnCloud

After all, I decided to rollback my name to Klaider Animekist.

## Youtube channels

- 1. https://www.youtube.com/user/KlaiderKlaiAnimekist/videos (All videos are mine, however I dropped this channel to a friend in 2013 ending and this friend renamed the channel to _otakugamer Jr_ and changed the description, however it was originally named _Klaider Klai_.)
